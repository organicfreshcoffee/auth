# 3D Models

This directory contains 3D model files used in the Organic Fresh Coffee landing page application.

## Directory Location

This directory is located at `client/public/assets/3d-models/` to ensure 3D models are served as static assets by Next.js. Files in the `public` directory can be referenced directly in your components using paths like `/assets/3d-models/filename.glb`.

## Usage in Next.js

To use 3D models in your Next.js components:

```javascript
// For Three.js with React Three Fiber
import { useLoader } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader'

function CoffeeModel() {
  const gltf = useLoader(GLTFLoader, '/assets/3d-models/coffee-cup.glb')
  return <primitive object={gltf.scene} />
}

// Or for direct URL references
const modelUrl = '/assets/3d-models/coffee-beans.glb'
```

## File Formats

- **`.glb`** - Binary glTF files (recommended for web)
- **`.gltf`** - Text-based glTF files with separate assets
- **`.fbx`** - Autodesk FBX format
- **`.obj`** - Wavefront OBJ format
- **`.blend`** - Blender source files

## Usage Guidelines

1. **License Compliance**: Always check the license of downloaded models
   - **CC0**: Public domain, no attribution required
   - **CC BY**: Attribution required
   - **Royalty-free**: Can be used without ongoing payments
   - **Editorial use**: May have restrictions on commercial use

2. **Attribution Format** (when required):
   ```
   Model Name by Author Name (Source URL)
   Licensed under [License Type]
   ```

3. **File Organization**:
   - Use descriptive filenames
   - Group related models in subfolders
   - Include source information in comments or separate text files

## Optimization for Web

When using 3D models in web applications:

- **Use glTF/GLB format** for best performance
- **Optimize polygon count** for smooth rendering
- **Compress textures** to reduce file size
- **Use Draco compression** for geometry compression
- **Consider LOD (Level of Detail)** for complex scenes

## Tools for 3D Model Processing

- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)** - Free, open-source 3D software
- **[glTF-Pipeline](https://github.com/CesiumGS/gltf-pipeline)** - Command-line tools for glTF optimization
- **[Draco](https://github.com/google/draco)** - 3D geometry compression
- **[Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/)** - Mesh processing and optimization
